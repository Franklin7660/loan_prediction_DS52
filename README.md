# 🏦  Loan Approval Prediction
This repository contains the work done for a university data science project based on the Kaggle competition: Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10

## 📚 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a loan will be approved or not, based on applicant and financial information.

This challenge is framed around a realistic binary classification problem, ideal for practicing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation techniques.
